# Quantum-Encryption
Quantum Encryption establishes secret keys using the laws of quantum physics. It is the only known method that guarantees future-proof security against quantum computers. Any eavesdropping attempt fundamentally disturbs the quantum state, creating detectable errors that force Alice and Bob to abort the session. Security is guaranteed by physics.
